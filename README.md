# CurvedLayer_FDM
Tools for the generation of curved paths for an arm-based FDM system.

These will be presented at ECCM 2018 with the paper "Application of an Arm-Based FDM System for Sandwich Panel Fabrication", by D. Pollard, G. Herrmann, C. Ward, J. Etches.

A video showing the operation is available at:
